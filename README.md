# Dictionary
This application takes word from the user as an input. Once the user provides input, this program compares the given input with the words
available in the application data. If the word is found, the application will tell the user the meaning/meanings of the word. Otherwise,
it suggests the user two alternatives if the user makes some typo and user can select one of the alternatives if he/she wants. However, if
the user do not provide existing word, the program will display a message saying it could not find the meaning for the given word.


# Running the test
This application can be either downloaded or cloned. In order to successfully run this application, data folder and dictionary.py file
should be inside same folder. Once they are in same folder, it can be run using any code editor.
